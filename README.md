# Text-encryption-and-decrytion
This python program will encrypt and decrypt any text entered.
This was one of my most difficult projects for me so far because I couldn't get the text to decipher back into its original text so far
With trial and error I eventually got it to work which put a bright smile on my face :)
I used the caeser cipher to decode the text.
